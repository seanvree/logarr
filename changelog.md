    <div class="releaseBody">_IMPORTANT: If updating to version _*4.5*_ from ANY previous version, you will need to re-create your config.php file in the /assets/config/ directory after updating._  
    You can do this by renaming your old config.php file, copying the file config.sample-06jun18.php to config.php, and then edit the newly created config.php file with your values. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Monitorr/logarr/wiki/NOTICE:-Updating-Logarr "Wiki") for more information.  

    - Config changes:  

    1\. "rftime" (changed) : Specifies how frequently (in milliseconds) the UI clock will synchronize time with the hosting webserver.  
    NOTE: Previously the digital clock would update only when an ajax call was made at the interval defined by this value. Logarr version later than 4.5 will now use browser time after initial page load, however, will "synchronize" the UI clock with the server's time at the interval defined by this value. This update drastically improves performance as ajax calls are not needed as frequently.  

    2\. "max-lines" (added) : Default line limit for all logs  
    NOTE: This value will drastically affect the loading time, and performance of Logarr. If the Logarr UI loads slow, lower this value and/or ensure your logs are not too large.Tags:  
    - latest - master  
    - develop - develop
